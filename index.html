			News for my experience in Apple<br/>	I had some interview before to join Apple
			I followed a traineeship and then we are collected some streets.<br/>
			You should be carefully about your environment,your neighborhood,the peoples and so on.<br/>
			each cities ,there is one or many dangerous district with thugs peoples.<br/>We had collected this area earlier in the morning when the thugs sleep.
			Your collect some area ,you work with your colleague , you are free for to take the lunch and for your mission, Each days you have a new mission if you did not finish yesterday mission.<br/>
			To be honest, i really loved my life in the netherlands, better than in france, people are more respectful, less suspicious, the working atmosphere is better than in france, there is no indirect racism like in France. The Dutch are kind to each other.
			the netherlands gives everyone a chance. It is very cosmopolitan we meet people who come from all over the world whether in eindhoven, amsterdam, The hague, Utrecht or Rotterdam. I loved the cycling culture and the feeling of freedom that it gave after working days. All the infrastructure of the country is made for bicycles, especially in utrecht and amsterdam.<br/>
			Every Dutch person I have met speaks English in everyday life in addition to Dutch. I find that fantastic, in France when we try to speak in English, we are then judged by people or we speak badly English and we are told, you have a bad accent and speak French ... it does not encourage you to develop your skills or either we speak good English and we are told stop being your show off. and that also does not encourage. In both directions we are pulled down, it's a crab basket environment<br/>
			To have a family life, it is one of the countries that I would choose because the education system is efficient (the children speak several languages) the work system allows not only to earn a living and to get a family life  because in the life this is a step to have a family life without hindering the professional career. Not only as a man but also as a woman. Many women work part-time and stay in senior positions as managers or project managers. All this while working 3 days a week the same for men and it in no way affects the productivity of the company. Because according to several studies, a full-time employee loses more time with discussions at the coffee machine than part-time who devote 100% to work when he is on the premises of the company.

					News about my experience with Linet<br/>
					Ronin like his name is international, peoples to work of this company<br/>are really open minds like all UK,
				it's my first time to working in the international environment,<br/>i say again today in my mind "Thank you Ronin" to give me this vision
				i seen many peoples <br/>prayor since the break work, all people are mixes ,<br/>we are totally different(some people were tattoo,some peoples were religious, some peoples smoke other not,<br/>each people love drink(not only water)other not, some people from african area ,<br/>some people from asian area,some peoples from american area and <br/>some people from europe each part of west of europe and each part of east europe) and we worked togother.<br/>
				I can't believe this situation. It's not only a company ,i was learning a new way of life and other vison.<br/> 
				England people you are lucky.<br/>This is not everywhere, Peoples can be freedom to wear what they want ,and do what they want.<br/>
				I followed during a short period the english course in college, for exemple my teacher had a hijab and other teacher have a sihks turban <br/>and you know what, i love that. Unfortunatly this situation is impossible in France. <BR/>Just for the girls you wear a short dress all mens to look you like a hooker and try to touch you. I say that because <br/>i talk with the womens and i have many good reliationship with french girls. I not accept this situation but it's the french mindset,<br/> the same about the clothes if you are a little bit different, for example you wear a turban or a hijab <BR/>or if you have tatoo many peoples looking you like a beast , weird look like for saying "i'm affraid".<br/>
				About the cons i recognize this job like boring jobs, when you do the first call , all the days is the same , try to reach a customer , ask many questions about the script.</p><br/>

				News about my experience with La poste<br/>
				Well , how can i starting my experience with La Poste. La poste it's a company like Royal mail in Uk.<br/>
			To be honest before to apply with La poste, i failed two apply (KFC and BurgerKing), i did it on purpose, because in the same time i studied at college (university) in night course 5 pm to 10 pm , and the hours to working in KFC or BurgerKing.<br/> . It's impossible for me to pursue my year in college if i was working in KFC or BurgerKing. And i wanted to keep going touch my allocation if i can't get a job.
			I explain in France , it's probably the best social system for the modest people and poor people, because there isn't really poor people in france.
			when you worked before (6 months minimum, you can get an allocation during 6 months, if you show at the gouverment that you looking for a job. And each months , you must to apply for one job for to pursue your allocation.
			I started my job of postman with a bike , i delivery just the letters (in evreux small town in Normandy) after 8 months with this company . My company said you move in a village Saint andré de l'eure . And now you going to work with a car . I delivered some parcel and letters.
			At the first my circuit it's small village like Garennes sur eure,La Couture boussey and Ivry la Bataille.<br/>
		
			Once a time my colleague is absent for depression and my supervisor decide for one week to sharing his circuit between me and other colleague(south partie for my colleague and north parties for me) after this week he recruited a new guys(because my colleague decided extend his absent) and me i taken this circuit. i don't had the choice to conserve my circuit  (my new circuit it's st georges motel and marcilly sur eure and others village like that).
			I stayed one week for this circuit because i submitted the racism indirectly and directly.
			my first day of this week alone it's ok 
			but my second it's not the same , i had a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt for a customer(client) when i rang the doorbell, i meet this guy , he said "you are the new postman and answered yes sir i'am your new postman , he said keep a distance of two meters with me and after that he go out taken gloves and look my registered letter with acknowlegment and refuse that, i accept his decision and i quit his home .Before to return on my car i meet the delivery man of chronopost(chronopost it's like DHl or Fedex) that delivery the parcel for this guy and i seen he take off the gloves and shakes his hand and hugs him and sign his paper. after the delivery man of chronopost came back of me and i said , Do you know him? he answer no it's my first time that i see him(delivery man of chronopost =caucasian kind and me black) <br/>at the time I did not know it but when talking with some friends, they told me it was indirect racism 
			the third day of this week , i realise a normal circuit until a tire was burst out , I parked my car because it was difficult to access an alley(there was a work vehicule in this alley) I go running with the letters in my hand and I leave my vehicle on blinker.On my arrival the tire rear right was die. I lost one hours minimum perhaps two hours because we are stolen my car jack and when i rang many doorbell of neighboor either peoples are absent or either are refused to lend a car jack.
			the fourth day is the worst day, i started my day on the desk boss. my boss said i received two complaints for letters and parcel not received and he said from the third you are going fired.
			during my circuit three peoples throw bananas in my car and scream loudly "for the monkey "   don't stay here return in your home country.
			i hadn't answer and i continued my circuit normally but i did not have a good feeling.
			AFTER THIS DAY , i decided to give up and left this job.</p> </article>

				News about my experience with RyderCup<br/>
				This missions is a temporary mission , i was a safety guard during one week, i worked hard each days fifteen hours per day, fortunaltly, this mission during one week, i remember i stayed stand up, after the works my whole body hurts.
			The first day i worked at the day (with a simple chief contract) since the second day until the final days i worked at night (not really night because i worked fifteen hours by days and i signed a new coordinator contract) i managed teams and elabored a safety plans with two others collaborators.including a coordinator who is very well known on the media and political level, but let's be honest, there were three of us, we were supposed to welcome the French and American president and I am the one who i did the most of the work. But it served me as an experience because from this experience I learned to adapt.<br/>
			just the first on the day when the company didn't give employees a break while some of them were working since ten hours already, I remember paying two sandwiches for my colleagues with the little savings I had, two tiny sandwiches but I couldn't afford pay sandwiches for three hundred agent with my savings.
			in addition to these three hundred agents, there were about four hundred other agents via the providers.<br/>
			I remember the first day I replaced many agents who had left the post. To be honest I understood them, because the conditions were really pushing to extremes and the company breaking several laws and using these poor agents. I felt sorry for them and just wanted to do my best to ensure that all the agents on my team held up and succeeded. It was mental work, but it was mostly human. I showed consideration for every agent on my team.

			The director of the event looked at all the team leaders and saw that strangely enough I was the only team where none of the agents had resigned. It was certainly difficult but still all the agents of the team were present. Following that he made me sign a new contract as coordinator after having carried out an in-depth investigation with the police, the gendarmerie, the secret services because I was going to be directly in contact with a leading political figure.<br/>


			i remember the second day i stayed stand up all night. i has replaced an agent in a important strategy position i stayed stand up for all the night. It's not easy. I remember the first day like the worst day and the most difficult day because we had not a break time and not foods .Fortunalty i had some food in my pocket (candy) it's not really food but i kept energy like that. But it's not the case for everyone agents. After third and fourth days the company propose a dormitory for agents like that we sleep to close the work. and also because some agents had cars accident because of the work rhythm.

			I'm not going to lie that working as a coordinator was a rewarding but trying experience, but I liked the challenge. I had less pressure than my other colleague coordinating days. But on the other hand, I helped him a lot and I even did more than what was necessary. I made it easier to work. In all the work I always give the best of myself to have no regrets. I analyze and ask for advice, I am open-minded, I accept criticism and I develop a constructive dialogue to find a solution to improve the problematic situation. I think adaptability is one of my qualities.

			I seen the best golf players of this planet.it's bad for good because it is thanks to this job that I resumed my studies because I was fed up with security, of being treated like a pawn, like a less than nothing, I wanted absolutely study go to university and challenge myself intellectually, I wanted to be more important socially, I wanted to be considered. Because I had a great lack of self-confidence, especially in my social and financial position.when I saw these  very important people socially, I said to myself why not me? I admire it deeply but I too can realize myself and become better, of course at my level but it constitutes an example in my eyes.</p><br/>

				News about my experience with Securitas<br/>
				At that time I lived in Nice, and I wanted to discover something else, another city and Paris made me vibrate.
			<br/>I wanted to live in Paris , get a job and working. I worked in airport safety .I check the luggage on the x-ray machine and I palpated the passengers when he triggered the security gate. <br/>No fun to do that mostly in summer when all passagers sweats. I was lucky if we can call it lucky because i earned one thousand four hundred per months while each colleague earn only eight hundred per months. Already that's difficult to live in paris with one thousand four hundred but not impossible. so with eight hundred let's not talk about it. Mainly to rent a studio, a room. you must earn three times the price of the rent (French laws)
			with this salary at the period i could rent only appartment less than 466 euros. I found it in the suburbs (Maisons Alfort) with camas formation I managed to obtain a student card since the rhythm of the months was two weeks in the center (camas formation) and two weeks in a company. Normally the average price of studio in paris is eight hundred per months for one bedroom is one thousand two hundred and in some neighborhood one thousand four hundred (my salary at this period). I love Paris , this city is wonderfull , probably the most beautiful but peoples are not nice like london. besides even if I did not succeed in financially holding on to London. I still think that if ever one day I manage to get a comfortable salary, I could live in London without any problem because I loved this city, the atmosphere and the people you can meet.  Paris and certainly beautiful but it lack of sympathy, Paris is perfect for holidays and London perfect for living. provided you have a minimum of income because they are the two most expensive cities in Europe after the Swiss cities.i really felt the cosmopolitan atmosphere in london without judgment towards anyone. each person chooses how it dresses as he wishes, my banker had tattoos, (something unthinkable in France). I felt an open mind and this is really the first time that I have felt good in a city. For the first time I was a normal man. There was not this indirect racism that can be found in France, some came to talk to me thinking that I was English asking me the way and I tried somehow to help them with my intermediate level in English.</p><br/>

			News about my experience with FCNissa<br/>	
			I was a mixed between coach and physical trainer, I condition the players to give the maximum of them on the ground on the mental level of course, I worked out strategies, team compositions.I specify mental condition because as a trainer, we can hardly do better than give them the best psychological conditions. We don't play for  them on the soccer field.i was satisfied by this job because soccer it's my passion. Let's be perfecly honest , i lived with my parents and my income for that was ridiculous fifty euros  per week.
